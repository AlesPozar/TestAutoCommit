(The DreamWorks Pictures SKG logo plays out, with dreamy music playing underneath. At the end of the logo,
the S's in "DreamWorks" and "SKG" turn green and grow out ogre ears, matching the film's logo. Credits 
saying "DreamWorks Pictures Presents" and "A PDI/DreamWorks Production" appear.)

(A ray of light shines down on a leather-bound storybook. The book opens and a Scottish-accented voice 
begins reading its text)

Shrek: Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful 
sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a 
terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison,
but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower. For her true 
love and true love's first kiss.

(Shrek chuckles and rips out a page of the book and closes it. Well, that’s okay!)

Shrek: Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flushes)

("All Star" by Smash Mouth Playing)

(We see an outhouse and hear the sound of a toilet flushing. Out steps Shrek, an ogre, who tugs at his 
underwear and shakes his foot of the page still stuck to his shoe. He looks lovingly at the swamp he calls 
home, and goes about his daily routine. Which is taking a mud shower, brushing his teeth with bugs, 
bathing in a muddy pond, gathering giant slugs for dinner, and painting a warning sign)

(In a nearby village, an angry mob gather up to go after Shrek. At night they gather their torches and 
pitchforks and enter the swamp, trampling over Shrek's warning signs. It’s fun to use our imagination, 
Shrek sees them after investigating the commotion, rolling his eyes. The villagers stop outside Shrek's 
home, unaware that Shrek is sneaking up behind them)

NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S SWAMP

Villager 1: Think it's in there?

Villager 2: All right. Let's get it!

Villager 1: Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?

Villager 3: Yeah, it'll grind your bones for its bread.

(Shrek chuckles, revealing himself to be standing behind the mob)

Shrek: Yes, well, actually, that would be a giant.

(The mob gasps)

Shrek: Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin...

(Shrek slowly approaches as the villagers back away in fear)

Villager: No!

Shrek: They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast.

Villager 1: Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya!

(The villager waves his torch in Shrek's face. Shrek casually licks his fingers and pinches the flame, 
extinguishing the torch. The villager drops it)

Villager 1: Right.

(Shrek terrifies the mob with a great frightening roar, his spit extinguishing all the remaining torches. 
He wipes his mouth and waits for the villagers to stop screaming)

Shrek: (whispering) This is the part where you run away.

Villagers: (gasping)

(Shrek laughs as the men drop their torches and pitchforks and run away as fast they can)

Shrek: And stay out!

(He looks down and picks up a wanted poster dropped by one of the villagers. He reads it aloud)

SHREK: "Wanted. Fairytale creatures"?

(He sighs and walks off. dropping the poster to the ground)

THE NEXT DAY - FOREST

Fairy tale creatures are put in chains and led into wagons by Duloc Guards. The Captain of the 
Duloc Guards sits at a table paying a line of people their rewards for turning in the fairytale creatures. 
Those waiting in line include Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Geppetto who is carrying
Pinocchio, and a farmer carrying the Three Little Pigs.

Guard: All right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!

The Captain: Next!

Guard: (Taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half)

The Captain: That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next!

(The captain hands over the reward to the villager who turned the witch in. 
The villager mutters to himself)

Villager: Lousy 20 pieces.

Guard: Get up! Come on!

(Waiting in line is Donkey on a leash and his owner. He looks in horror at the witch and a group of
dwarves being
