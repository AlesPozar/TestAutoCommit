(The DreamWorks Pictures SKG logo plays out, with dreamy music playing underneath. At the end of the logo,
the S's in "DreamWorks" and "SKG" turn green and grow out ogre ears, matching the film's logo. Credits 
saying "DreamWorks Pictures Presents" and "A PDI/DreamWorks Production" appear.)

(A ray of light shines down on a leather-bound storybook. The book opens and a Scottish-accented voice 
begins reading its text)

Shrek: Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful 
sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a 
terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison,
but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower. For her true

bathing in a muddy pond, gathering giant slugs for dinner, and painting a warning sign)

(In a nearby village, an angry mob gather up to go after Shrek. At night they gather their torches and 
pitchforks and enter the swamp, trampling over Shrek's warning signs. It’s fun to use our imagination, 
Shrek sees them after investigating the commotion, rolling his eyes. The villagers stop outside Shrek's 
home, unaware that Shrek is sneaking up behind them)

NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S SWAMP

Villager 1: Think it's in there?

Villager 2: All right. Let's get it!

Villager 1: Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?

Villager 3: Yeah, it'll grind your bones for its bread.

(Shrek chuckles, revealing himself to be standing behind the mob)

Shrek: Yes, well, actually, that would b
